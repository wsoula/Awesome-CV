With 15+ years of experience in the software development industry, I started when companies were just switching to agile and then
was involved in the push for infrastructure automation starting with chef and then moving to docker.  This understading of how
things were built and deployed made me integral to the operations of multiple companies, each sadder than the last to see me move on.
  I have a unique passion for monitoring, building dashboards, and attention to detail that has dovetailed nicely with what has
become called Site Reliability Engineer.  I look forward to building a toolset to take companies along for the Site Reliablity
Engineer journey.
